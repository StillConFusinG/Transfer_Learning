# Transfer Learning: How it works!
Run the above code using these steps. `data_kaggle_catsNdogs.tar.bz2` contains features extracted usoing VGG-CNN in matlab. Code for that also given. The python SVM implemented here also contains [hyper-parameter optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization) which delas with model selection and reducing over-fitting of training data.
